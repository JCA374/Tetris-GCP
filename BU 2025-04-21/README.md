# GPU-Optimized DQN Tetris Training

This project implements a highly optimized Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent for learning to play Tetris, specifically designed to maximize GPU utilization on NVIDIA GPUs.

## Key Features

- **GPU-Accelerated Training**: Optimized data flow to keep your GPU busy
- **Vectorized Environments**: Run multiple Tetris games in parallel for faster data collection
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Uses Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) for up to 2x speedup
- **GPU-Optimized Replay Buffer**: Stores transitions directly on the GPU to eliminate transfer overhead
- **Memory-Mapped Storage**: Support for very large replay buffers beyond GPU memory capacity
- **Parallel Evaluation**: Efficient agent evaluation across multiple environments
- **Performance Profiling**: Built-in tools to identify and fix bottlenecks
- **Curriculum Learning**: Structured learning progression to improve training efficiency

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.9+
- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (tested on T4)
- 8GB+ GPU memory recommended

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dqn-tetris-gpu.git
cd dqn-tetris-gpu
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Verify GPU availability:
```bash
python -c "import torch; print('GPU available:', torch.cuda.is_available(), '- Device:', torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'None')"
```

## Quick Start

Run training with default settings:

```bash
python run_gpu_optimized.py
```

This will:
1. Create a vectorized environment with 8 parallel Tetris games
2. Initialize a GPU-optimized DQN agent with GPU replay buffer
3. Train using mixed-precision (AMP) if available
4. Save checkpoints to prevent data loss from VM preemption

### Components

#### 1. GPU-Optimized Replay Buffer
- Stores transitions directly on GPU memory
- Eliminates CPU-GPU transfer overhead during sampling
- Supports prioritized experience replay
- Automatically handles terminal states

```python
# Example usage:
from gpu_replay_buffer import GPUReplayBuffer

buffer = GPUReplayBuffer(
    capacity=100000,
    device="cuda"
)
```

#### 2. Memory-Mapped Buffer
- For very large replay buffers beyond GPU memory capacity
- Uses disk storage with efficient prefetching
- Supports multi-million-sample buffers with minimal GPU memory

```python
# Example usage:
from mmap_replay_buffer import MemoryMappedGPUBuffer

buffer = MemoryMappedGPUBuffer(
    capacity=1000000,
    state_shape=(4, 14, 7),  # (C, H, W)
    device="cuda"
)
```

#### 3. Vectorized Environment
- Runs multiple Tetris games in parallel
- Synchronous or asynchronous implementations
- Efficiently batches observations for the agent

```python
# Example usage:
from vectorized_env import VectorizedTetrisEnv

env = VectorizedTetrisEnv(
    num_envs=8,
    grid_width=7,
    grid_height=14
)
```

#### 4. GPU-Optimized Preprocessing
- Efficiently processes states directly on the GPU
- Handles batch processing with pinned memory
- Uses non-blocking transfers for better overlap

```python
# Example usage:
from gpu_preprocess import BatchPreprocessor

preprocessor = BatchPreprocessor(
    device="cuda",
    binary=False,
    include_piece_info=True
)
```

#### 5. AMP-Enabled Training
- Uses PyTorch Automatic Mixed Precision
- FP16 for forward/backward passes
- FP32 for sensitive operations
- Gradient scaling to prevent underflow

```python
# Example usage is built into the agent.learn_amp() method
```

#### 6. Performance Profiling
- Identifies training bottlenecks
- Tracks GPU utilization and memory usage
- Generates reports with optimization recommendations

```python
# Example usage:
from profiler import PerformanceProfiler

profiler = PerformanceProfiler(device="cuda")
profiler.start_step()

# ... training code ...

profiler.end_step(loss=loss.item(), batch_size=batch_size)
profiler.generate_report("report.md")
```

## Optimizing Performance

### GPU Memory Optimization

- **Batch Size**: The batch size has the largest impact on GPU utilization. Increase it until you approach GPU memory limits.
- **Mixed Precision**: Enable AMP for reduced memory usage and faster computation.
- **Memory-Mapped Buffer**: For very large replay buffers, use the memory-mapped implementation.

### CPU Bottlenecks

If your profiling shows environment stepping as a bottleneck:

1. Increase parallel environments (`--parallel-envs`)
2. Use async environments (`--async-envs`)
3. Simplify environment calculations if possible

### GPU Utilization

If your GPU utilization is low (<50%):

1. Increase batch size
2. Use a larger model (more layers/filters)
3. Ensure you're using the GPU replay buffer
4. Check for synchronous CPU operations blocking GPU work

## Results & Performance

On an NVIDIA T4 GPU with optimized settings:

- **Training Speed**: ~200-400 episodes per hour (vs ~50 episodes per hour non-optimized)
- **GPU Utilization**: 80-95% (vs 10-30% non-optimized)
- **Sample Efficiency**: ~30% fewer samples to reach same performance with prioritized replay
- **Memory Usage**: Can handle 1M+ replay buffer capacity with memory mapping

## Training Curriculum

The implementation uses curriculum learning to structure the training process:

1. **Phase 1 (0-33%)**: Focuses on discovering line clearing with minimal penalties
2. **Phase 2 (33-66%)**: Introduces moderate penalties for board height and holes
3. **Phase 3 (66-100%)**: Full penalties for proper board management

This progression helps the agent learn fundamental concepts before tackling complex strategies.
